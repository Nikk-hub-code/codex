    Here is the instruction how it works:
    
        You are supposed to enter the operator which the calculator will understand and proceed accordingly.
        
        The operators are:-
                            '+' -> If you wants to add two numbers
                            '-' -> If you wants to subtract two numbers
                            '*' -> If you wants to multiply two numbers 
                            '/' -> If you wants to divide two numbers 
                            '**' -> If you wants to find the raise to power
                            '%' -> If you wants to find the remainder after dividing two numbers
                            '//' -> If you wants to find the quotient after dividing two numbers
                            '!' -> If you wants to find the factorial of a number
                            
                            NOTE => If you don't enter any number the calculator will consider it as 0.
                            
                    HOPE THIS CALCULATOR WILL HELP YOU TO FIND THE SOLUTION OF YOUR QUESTIONS!!
